# Violent Monkey Scripts
[Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
This repository contains some of my scrips. You may download and use them however you want (see license).
Currently, these are the scripts:
* [Avanza](https://www.avanza.se): some utility scripts that make the website easier to navigate (and prob. reduces your browser's and their server's load)
    * Triggered "kurslarm" that are still active are highlighted.
    * Search and go to a stock's page using a prompt.
    * Place an alert from any page through prompts.
    * Place an alert by hovering over the chart.

#### Disclaimer
There is no guarantee that these scripts will work for you. You might have to do some debugging.
